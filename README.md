A wedding planning app made using JavaFX for GUI and Oracle for database and connected using jdbc

Note: The author name says Terry, because I was using my fiance's version of Eclipse to create this project, so I was able to connect to the database.
I work on a Mac, usually, but needed a Windows machine to complete this project. All the work is my own.
