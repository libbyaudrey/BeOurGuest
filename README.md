# BeOurGuest
A wedding planning app made using JavaFX for GUI and Oracle for database and connected using jdbc

Note: The author name says Terry, because I was using my fiance's version of Eclipse to create this project, so I was able to connect to the database.
I work on a Mac, usually, but needed a Windows machine to complete this project. All the work is my own.

This app can add, edit and remove weddings, wedding guests, wedding vendors and wedding events from four tables in the Be Our Guest database.
